# Project Blueprint: Global Stock Community Website

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and progress for creating a global stock community website. The goal is to build a modern, responsive, and real-time platform for stock market enthusiasts.

## Core Technologies

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
*   **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting)
*   **Charting:** Chart.js with data from a free stock API.

## Design & Style

*   **Theme:** Dark, trading-style UI.
*   **Layout:** Responsive layout with a header, left sidebar, main content area, and a right chat panel.
*   **Colors:** Dark background (`#0f1115`), with neon green and red accents for stock-related elements.

## Implemented Features

### V1 (Initial Setup)

*   **HTML Structure:** Basic layout with `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`.
*   **UI Mockup:** Placeholder sections for all main UI components.
*   **Styling:** Initial dark theme and responsive layout.
*   **Firebase:** Added Firebase SDKs and placeholder for configuration.

## Current Plan

I will now create the basic HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript file. I will also add the Firebase SDKs and a placeholder for the Firebase configuration.
